# Cgroups
- So We Learned that underlying Docker Host as well as the containers share the same system resources such as CPU and Memory.
- How much of the resources are dedicated to the host and the containers?
- How much does Docker manage and share the resources between the containers?
- By default, there is no restriction as to how much of a resource a container can use.
- And hence, a container may end up utilizing all of the resources on the underlying host.
- But there is a way to restrict the amount of CPU or memeory a container can use.
- Docker uses Cgroups or control groups to restrict the amount of hardware resources allocated to each container
- THis can be Done by providing the --cpu option to the Docker run command
