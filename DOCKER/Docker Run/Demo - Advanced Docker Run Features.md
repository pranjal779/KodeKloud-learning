This is an update for the Jenkins image.

In our upcoming demo video, I used a jenkins image which is now deprecated. Instead of that, we have to use jenkins/jenkins.

In the demo video, I used the command:-

docker run jenkins

But as of now, we have to use the following command:-

docker run jenkins/jenkins
