Here’s a breakdown of the commands and concepts from your KodeKloud Linux lab with clear explanations and correct examples for permissions and ownership.

***

## `ls -ld /home/bob/random_dir`

- **Purpose:**  
  Shows detailed information (permissions, owner, group, etc.) for the directory itself, **not its contents**.
- **Explanation:**  
  - The `-l` flag gives you a “long” listing, which means you see permissions, ownership, size, date, and name.
  - The `-d` flag means “directory” — it will show info about the directory **as an item**, not list its contents.
  - Usage:  
    ```
    ls -ld /home/bob/random_dir
    ```
  - Handy for checking the permissions and ownership for a single directory when troubleshooting or assigning rights.[1][2][3]
- **Alternatives to Check Permissions/Ownership:**  
  - `ls -l /path/to/directory` — Shows directory contents with permissions/ownership for each file/folder inside.
  - `stat /path/to/item` — Gives even more detailed info about permissions, ownership, and timestamps.[2]
  - `getfacl /path/to/item` — Shows file Access Control Lists if used.

## Modifying Permissions with `chmod`

### Syntax and Symbols

| Symbol | What it Means   | Example                    | Result                                       |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `u`    | user/owner      | `chmod u+r file`           | Add read for user                            |
| `g`    | group           | `chmod g-w file`           | Remove write for group                       |
| `o`    | others          | `chmod o+x file`           | Add execute for others                       |
| `a`    | all (u,g,o)     | `chmod a+r file`           | Add read for everyone                        |
| `+`    | add permission  | `chmod g+x file`           | Add execute for group                        |
| `-`    | remove perm     | `chmod o-w file`           | Remove write from others                     |
| `=`    | set exact perm  | `chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r file`| Overwrite, set only specified permissions    |

***

### Why `chmod u+rwx,g+r-x,o+r-x` is incorrect

- `g+r-x` and `o+r-x` are not valid… You can only use `+` or `-` with one permission at a time:  
  - `g+r-x` tries to both add and remove in one flag, which won't work.
- The correct way:
  - To add read for group and remove execute:  
    `chmod g+r,g-x /home/bob/sports/soccer`
  - To do several at once, combine changes with commas:
    ```
    chmod u+rwx,g+rw,g-x,o+rw,o-x /home/bob/sports/soccer
    ```
    or if you want to set them exactly (overwriting old ones):
    ```
    chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o=rw /home/bob/sports/soccer
    ```

**Tip:**  
- Use `+` to **add** permission, `-` to **remove**, and `=` to **set exactly**.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10]
- Always separate changes with commas, not dashes in a single flag.

***

### Use of `chmod go`:

- `go` targets group and others at the same time.
  - `chmod go-wx file` removes write and execute from both group and others.[11][8]

***

## Good Examples

```sh
chmod u+rwx /home/bob/sports/soccer      # Add full permissions for user/owner only
chmod g+w /home/bob/sports/soccer        # Add write for group only
chmod o-x /home/bob/sports/soccer        # Remove execute from others only
chmod go-wx /home/bob/sports/soccer      # Remove write and execute from group and others
chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r /home/bob/sports/soccer  # Set exact permissions
```

**Summary Table: chmod Usage**

| Task                    | Command                                         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| List permissions        | `ls -ld /path/to/dir` or `ls -l`                |
| Add permission          | `chmod [ugoa]+[rwx] file`                       |
| Remove permission       | `chmod [ugoa]-[rwx] file`                       |
| Set exact permissions   | `chmod [ugoa]=[rwx] file`                       |
| Change group/others     | `chmod go-[rwx] file` or `chmod go+[rwx] file`  |
