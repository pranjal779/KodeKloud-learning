## What is GIT?
What is the single most important tool that Developers and Operations teams must know alike today? Git! Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers and operations teams to collaborate and keep track of the changes made on a project. GIT, as a DevOps tool, empowers collaboration and faster release cycles. Anyone willing to start their DevOps career or level up should start from the basics, and GIT is the most fundamental requirement of all.

## Why You Should Use GIT
Many of the most popular open-source projects today are developed on Github -- Kubernetes, Ansible, Tensor Flow, Rust, Node.js, Go, Terraform, and Helm Charts being some of the top ones among the 100 million repositories. If you would like to learn and contribute to these projects, understanding Git is a must, and our GIT for beginners course is here to help!

This is a beginner-level GIT tutorial course and is well structured with lectures and labs for those who are absolute beginners to GIT. System Administrators, Developers, or IT engineers without prior experience may go through this course to gain basic knowledge of GIT.

## GIT for Beginner's Course -- What You Will Learn
