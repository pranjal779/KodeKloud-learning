Ansible vs Terraform
So While terraform is more if an infrastructure provisioning tool ansible is an automation tool that helps configure these infrastruture once provisioned not that there are many areas both terraform and asnible overlap.  
Both of these tools can provision infrastructure and automate software configuration on them.  
But each has its own benefits in different areas.  
So while terrraform is used mostly for provisioning and deprovisioning infrastructure ansible is used for post configuration activities such as installing the software and configuring them on those servers.  
So similar to terraform ansible uses code to configure service. it's called ansible playbook and this code also goes to the source code repository on GitHub.

So any code pushed now goes through the pipeline and we have that we have defined and its automatically built tested and deployed sooner resulting in multiple deployes to production every day and once deployed it is monitored and more fedback is retrieved from the user and this cycle repeats on to Infinity.  
And this is what devops is devops is a combination of people processes and tools that work together in going from an idea to execution and delivering high quality software consistently.
