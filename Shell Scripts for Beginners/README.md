It can help save time and increase productivity. So it’s a must have skill for any one working on computers. Shell scripts can be used to automate repetitive tasks such as performing daily backups of your system or installing and patch packages on multiple servers, or monitoring the system periodically such as to check the memory, cpu and disk usage and raise alarms if required, or perform regular audits on a system such as to identify logged in users monitor activities performed by users or to identify processes consuming most resources or search through multiple log files and identify root cause of problems etc. This course is a beginner level course and is for those who are absolute beginners to shell scripting or programming. System Administrators, Developers or IT engineers who do not have any prior programming experience can go through this course to gain basic knowledge of shell scripting. As part of this course we will explain the necessary programming concepts required for shell scripting. And we learn in a fun way using examples of a space station launching missions to explore the universe. As well as our embedded hands-on labs that will make sure you gain enough hands-on practice right after you learn each concept. We will test your scripts to make sure you have written them correctly and also provide feedback. This course is divided into different sections where we discuss what shell scripts are and how to get started with your first shell script. We discuss how to make your scripts executable. We discuss various concepts related to scripting such as variables, control logics such as conditional statements, loops such as for loops and while loops, arithmetic operations etc. And throughout the course we will also discuss best practices while scripting such as what to do and what not to do and how to develop a script that’s reusable. We will also see some tips and tricks such as some IDEs and utilities that can help you improve your scripting skills.
